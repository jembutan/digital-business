The basic daily fee is paid by everyone and is set by the department of health and aged care. There are fees for living in all care homes. Instead, daily living cost will be set as a national, notional amount of £200 per week (in 2021 to 2022 prices), which will apply to anyone who receives care in a care home. It is for families who can’t access other types of approved care.
